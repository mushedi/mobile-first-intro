                    Maracuya is native to Brazil, but also found parts of Paraguay, Argentina, Peru and Columbia. 
                    When selecting a maracuya, pick the heaviest of the options. 
                    In the United States, it can be difficult to find in stores. 
                    Whole Foods is a likely spot, especially in warm climates such as California. 
                    The fruit is egg-shaped in nature, similar to a mango. 
                    Almost 1/3 of the fruit is actually composed of water, so while it is heavy, it's not as dense as anticipated.
                    It's best to slice the fruit open and eat it with a spoon. 
                    Begin by cutting the fruit in half, from the stem to the bottom. 
                    Another option is to cut the top off the fruit and scoop out the insides. 
                    The seeds and pulp should be removed and can be eaten separately. Once the skin on the fruit has creased, it's ripe and ready to be eaten.
